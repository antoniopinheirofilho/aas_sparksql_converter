# DAX to SparkSQL UC Metric View Conversion Results

================================================================================

Based on the provided DAX expressions, here are the converted Unity Catalog Metric View measures in SparkSQL format:

```yaml
- name: Val City Taxes
  # SUM('Fato Sales'[CITY_TAX])
  expr: SUM(CITY_TAX)

- name: Val State Taxes
  # SUM('Fato Sales'[STATE_TAX])
  expr: SUM(STATE_TAX)

- name: Val Total Taxes
  # [Val City Taxes]+[Val State Taxes]
  expr: SUM(CITY_TAX) + SUM(STATE_TAX)
```

### Conversion Notes:

1. **Val City Taxes**: Direct conversion from DAX SUM function to SparkSQL SUM, removing the table reference as it's implicit in the metric view context.

2. **Val State Taxes**: Same pattern as above - straightforward SUM aggregation.

3. **Val Total Taxes**: The DAX expression references other measures using square brackets. In SparkSQL for UC Metric Views, I've expanded this to the underlying calculations (SUM(CITY_TAX) + SUM(STATE_TAX)) rather than using measure references, which maintains the same logic while being more explicit and performant.

All conversions maintain the original intent and logic of the DAX expressions while following SparkSQL syntax conventions for Unity Catalog Metric Views.
